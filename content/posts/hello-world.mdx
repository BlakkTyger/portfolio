# Welcome

This is my first blog post on this portfolio. I built this site using:

- **Next.js 15** for the framework
- **Three.js** for 3D graphics
- **GSAP** for animations
- **MDX** for this blog

<Alert type="info">
This is a custom Alert component embedded in MDX!

## Why I Built This

I wanted a portfolio that reflects my interests in physics and programming. The intersection of these fields is where the most interesting problems live.

<Callout emoji="🔬">
The particle system in the background simulates Brownian motion!
</Callout>

## Code Example

Here's how the particle physics works:

```typescript
// Apply Brownian motion
particle.velocity.x += (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.002;
particle.velocity.y += (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.002;
```

Thanks for reading!
